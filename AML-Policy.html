                                        framework put in place by India to combat money laundering and related crimes.
                                        PMLA and the Rules notified there under came into force from 1st July, 2005.
                                        Under PMLA, all the entries registered with SEBI are required to furnish
                                        information of all the suspicious transactions whether or not made in cash to
                                        FIU-IND. Under Section3 of PMLA, projecting of crime as untainted property is an
                                        offence of money

                                        Money Laundering involves disguising financial assets so that they can be used
                                        without detection of the illegal activity that produced them. Through money
                                        laundering, the launderer transforms the monetary proceeds derived from criminal
                                        activity into funds with as apparently legal source.

                                        SEBI has prescribed the minimum requirements relating to KYC for certain classes
                                        of registered intermediaries from time to time. Taking into account the basic
                                        principles enshrined in the KYC norms, internal guidelines should be followed in
                                        dealing with clients and legal requirements as per the established practices.
                                        Also, maintain continuous familiarity and follow-up where it notices
                                        inconsistencies in the information provided by the client. The principles
                                        enshrined in the PML Act, 2002 as well as the SEBI Act, 1992 should be followed,
